### Community Agreement

  

TL;DR: Be kind. Be mindful. Be Inclusive.  
  

Fellows in the NYC Mayor's Office of the Chief Technology Officer consist of people from diverse backgrounds to ensure that the solutions developed by MOCTO reflect the diversity of people in New York City. Each Fellow brings a unique perspective to the table and we value that perspective.  
  

Cultivating a healthy work culture is an important component of MOCTO’s vision for all of our Fellows programs. To ensure that Fellows have a rewarding experience, we need agreement on how we relate to each other during our short but intense sprints.  
  

As a Fellow, you agree to the following:

#### Account for your workload capacity and take care of yourself

We understand the importance of preventing burnout. If you have constraints and need to step back, let your team know so they can manage the workload and still meet deadlines.  
  
Take breaks when needed so your work is accurate and remains inspiring. Also, please be comfortable in saying ‘no’ to asks that are beyond your capacity.  
  

#### Be mindful of the voices that are not represented

Sometimes, voices that are needed in the room are not always available or may have been accidentally left out of the discussion. Please actively consider who is represented and if you notice that key voices are not included, alert us so that we can ensure critical perspectives get incorporated.  
  

#### Promote patience and problem solving in the face of incomplete information

Our team is distributed and decentralized and sometimes information may be incomplete or changing. Accurate and timely information is key to making good decisions, however, being able to plan for delays in information and patience is also key. When situations are ambiguous or unclear, we want you to feel empowered to ask questions, seek information, and assess your ability to move forward.  
  

#### Embrace curiosity rather than frustration

There may be times when you feel frustrated in your project. Next steps may become unclear or decision-makers may not initially answer what you see as fundamental questions. Productive tension is welcome. Embrace lack of clarity as an opportunity to learn. Ask tough questions politely, while assuming best intent.

#### Foster inclusivity

The City prohibits conduct which unreasonably interferes with job performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment, or creates an abusive working environment based on any protected characteristic.

  

Examples of harassment includes, but is not limited to:  
  

-   hostility, physical aggression, intimidation, or unequal treatment
    
-   abusive acts or language
    
-   making lewd or sexual comments about an individual’s appearance, body, or style of dress
    
-   unwelcome or inappropriate touching
    
-   displaying pornographic images, cartoons, or graffiti on computers, emails, cell phones, etc.
    
-   making sexist remarks or derogatory comments based on gender
    

  
  

If while working with MOCTO you would like to discuss a concern, please contact your MOCTO supervisor, or their manager. 

  

#### Celebrate yourself and each other!

Your cohort of Fellows will be successful because of your desire to serve New Yorkers. From thanking people directly, to emoji high-fiving , every action taken in this program is an act of service in making tech work for all New Yorkers. These efforts deserve appreciation, recognition, and gratitude. Thank you for joining MOCTO- we are excited to collaborate with you!
